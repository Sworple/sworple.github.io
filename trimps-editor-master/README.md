# Save Editor for Trimps

Try out the editor [http://blog.boushley.net/trimps-editor/](http://blog.boushley.net/trimps-editor/)

This is a save editor for the game of [Trimps](http://trimps.github.io/)

I created this because I got addicted to the game, and the best way for me to get over it
was to create a way for me to get over the game.
